# 🦸‍♂️ GatotRider

**GatotRider** is a 2D platformer game featuring the legendary Indonesian hero, **Gatotkaca**. This project was developed to demonstrate the implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using the **Greenfoot** framework.

The game challenges players to navigate Gatotkaca through obstacles, utilizing Java-based logic for physics, collision detection, and actor behavior.
